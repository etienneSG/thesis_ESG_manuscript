\chapter{Introduction}
\label{chap:intro:en}


The research made in this thesis deals with Supply Chain Management.
They were funded by Argon consulting which is an independent consulting firm whose mission is to help its clients to improve every part of their Supply Chain (from the procurement of raw materials to the deliver of the final product) and conducted throughout an industrial partnership with the \'Ecole des Ponts ParisTech.
The objective is to develop methods to manage specific parts of the Supply Chain in an optimal way.



The common thread of the three topics developed in this thesis is the \emph{flexibility}.
The flexibility is the ability to deliver a service or a product to a costumer although the environment and the future is uncertain.
Depending on the level of decision, the flexibility is either a constraint (like the ability of an assembly line to easily switch from the production of one item to another) or a decision variable (like deciding between specialization and versatility).
In general, the closer to the final costumer are the decisions, the more they are subject to flexibility decisions taken by Supply Chain.


Our first topic deals with multi-sourcing of production that aims at deciding the flexibility of means of production.
The second and third topics deals with the reduction of inventories subject to flexibility decisions that were already made.


\section{Multi-sourcing of production}
\label{sec:intro:en:multi-sourcing}


Multi-sourcing of production is a strategic decision in Supply Chain management (\ie a long-term decision).
It consists in deciding if a plant should have the ability to produce an item.
For example, in \cref{fig:intro:en:multi-sourcing}, the first plant can produce item A, B and C while the second one can produce item B, C and D.
Then, item A and D are said to be mono-sourced since each can be produced by only one plant whereas item B and C are said to be multi-sourced since they can be produced by at least two plants.
The first characteristic of multi-sourcing decision is their horizon.
They take time to be implemented and have long-term impact on Supply Chain management.
Second, multi-sourcing decisions in a highly uncertain environment.
Among others, the future customer demands, the reliability of means of production, the future availability of raw materials are imperfectly known.
Finally, multi-sourcing decisions will constrain the future production decisions (\ie mid-term decision).
Precisely, they determine the flexibility of the plants and the ability to balance the workload between them.

\medskip


To model the multi-sourcing problem, we relies on \emph{Stochastic Optimization} which studies optimization problem that involves random objective function or random constraints.
The general formulation of stochastic programs is of the form
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rl}
  \mbox{Minimize} \quad & f(x) + \espe_{\va\xi}\sqbracket{Q\bracket{x,\va\xi}} \\
  \mbox{Subject to} \quad & x \in X
\end{array}
\end{equation}
where $\espe_{\va\xi}\sqbracket{.}$ is the expected value over $\va\xi\in\Xi$ and $Q\bracket{x,\va\xi}$ is a recourse function.
The variables $x$ are the first stage variables.
They are decided before knowing the realization of the randomness.
The parameter $\va\xi$ contains all the randomness in the second stage including the recourse variable which are decision taken knowing the realization of the randomness.
We apply a classical approximation scheme to solve the stochastic program doing first a two-stages approximation and then a sampling of scenarios in order to get a \emph{mixed integer linear program (MILP)}.


\medskip


Considering its applications, Argon Consulting choose to model the demand as the main source of uncertainty and consider that the total volume of demand is known.
(In its applications, Argon Consulting is interested by the ability to face variation in the products mix and not in the volume of demand.)
Then, we propose a model where the first stage variables are the assignment of item to plants and the second stage variable are the production decisions.
In order to deal with randomness and to capture the long-term impact and the risk of assignment decision, we rely on \emph{risk measures} that were first used in financial applications to quantify the risk of a financial position.
We choose to use \emph{Average Value-at-Risk ($\AVaR$)} applied to the inventory level of items which is unusual in supply chain applications.
Indeed, high inventory level is expensive but enables to easily satisfy demand.
Reducing inventory is then risky and Average Value-at-Risk aims at quantify the risk of this decision.


The Average Value-at-Risk at $\alpha\%$ (also known as expected shortfall) can be interpreted as the expectation restricted to the $\alpha\%$ worst cases, \ie $\alpha\%$ lowest values of inventory.
It enables the decisions maker to have an indicator which captures both the shortfall probability and the undelivered quantity (which are strongly linked to two indicator used to measure service level: the cycle service level and the fill rate service level).
Moreover, the parameter $\alpha$ enables to try several risk levels and Average Value-at-Risk can be linearized in order to be used in a MILP formulation leading to tractable formulation.


\medskip


Real datasets got from Argon Consulting's clients do not contained only historical value of productions and sales.
Since we do not have the real demand, we propose a probabilistic model to generate possible realizations of demand from historical values.
This model is based on \emph{Dirichlet distributions} and aims at being easy to use.
Its only input are a forecast demand (which can be the historical sales or the historical forecast) and a volatility which is a percentage standing for to the accuracy of the forecast.
(The lowest is the volatility the more accurate is the forecast.)
Then, our probabilistic model provides scenarios of demand such that the total volume of demand is the same in each scenario, such that the expectation of a realization is equal to the forecast and such that the standard deviation divided by the expectation is close to the volatility.
This model meets the assumption made by Argon Consulting on the demand, has few parameters and is easy to simulate (even conditionally to the past).


\medskip


Finally, on real datasets, computation times may be long.
Up-to-date solvers are often unable to find an feasible solution of the problem.
Then, we propose an heuristic methods which enables to quickly find a feasible solution of the multi-sourcing problem.
The returned solution can be directly used by Argon Consulting's clients or as an initial solution of a generic solver.


\medskip


Our experimentations are not sufficient to prove the complete efficiency of the method.
The main weakness is that the method is too dependent on the sampling methods.
Indeed, actual computer performances and real dataset sizes prevent from dealing with more than a hundred of scenarios.
Thus, the choice of a representative set of scenarios is critical.
We suggest some leads to removed this dependence as generating more scenarios and using clustering methods (like $K$-means) to reduce to a smallest set of representative scenarios.
For lack of time, we have not yet implemented and tested this method.



\section{Continuous-time inventory models}
\label{sec:intro:en:continuous-time-inventory-models}


Argon Consulting uses continuous-time inventory models to compute macroscopic parameters at tactical level (mid-term decisions).
The \emph{lot-size} that gives the quantity of sames item produced at each production launch or the \emph{cover-size} that gives the number of time units following a production launch during which inventory must be positive are classical example.
These parameters are used as input for other decision process in Supply Chain as for the Material Requirement Planning (MRP).
For example, having an estimation of the lot-sizes or the cover-sizes enables to decide the quantity of raw materials that must be ordered.
They are also used as input to plan the production since they gives the sizes of produced batches.
(When studying discrete-time models, we will free from this constraint.)


Continuous-time inventory models consider a continuous vision of time.
The seminal model known as the \emph{Economic Order Quantity (EOQ)} model from \citet{Harris1913} enables to compute the optimal trade-off between ordering and holding cost.
In practice, EOQ formula is hard to use since ordering and holding costs are hard to compare.
Argon Consulting aims at finding the optimal lot-sizes (or cover-sizes) from the flexibility of its assembly lines which is a constraints defines by previous Supply Chain process.
An assembly line can produce several items by lose time when switching from the production of one item to another.
Considering a constant demand rate, \cref{fig:intro:en:continuous-time-inventory-model} shows the consequences of several length of production cycle.
Too short production cycle lead to stock-out since too much time is spend to switch between the production of two items whereas too long production cycle lead to unnecessary high inventory and unproductive time.
In real dataset, assembly line produce a lot of items and time lost due to switching from to different production is model by a maximal number of setups.

\end{figure}


\medskip


Replacing the ordering costs by an upper bound on the number of setups, we propose generalizations of the classical EOQ formula for multiple items.
In particular, we study continuous and integer number of setups in deterministic and stochastic settings.
Moreover, we also study an extension that considers several parallel assembly lines and show that the problem can be stated as a problem of the minimization of a concave function over a polyhedron (for which there exists an extensive literature).
